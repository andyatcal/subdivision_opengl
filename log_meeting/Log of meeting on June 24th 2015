Log of meeting on June 24th 2015

1. We will use halfedge data structure for this cc project. (cc : catmull-clark)

1.1 With the coming "misoritable" object feature, we need to modify the traversal of halfedges. Possibly: go to the sibling edge -> move forward once -> move backward twice.

2. We will implement the first level of cc, then move on to the recursive generation of sublevels.

3. Milestonnes of this cc project.

3.1 Normal cc -> test with cube and normal strip. First Level.
3.2 CC with infinite sharp edge-> test with normal strip. First Level.
3.3 CC complied with "misorintable" object. First Level.
3.4 Recursively generation of sublevels.

4. Generate new mesh from the original mesh without changing the oringinal mesh. And show both in OpenGL.

5. Reference of cc project: 

5.1 https://github.com/parsoj/CatmullClark/blob/master/main.cpp
5.2 Jordan Smith - slide.

6. Do the topology of subdivision first: adding methods to the halfedge data structure. Then compute the values of those points.
Topology: edgepoint -> facepoint -> vertexpoint
Compute: facepoint -> edgepoint -> vertexpoint

7. Offset in the future:

7.1 1) Crossproduct of vectors to two adjacent neighbour. 2) Normalize and average all crossproducts.
7.2 Newell algorithm for plane fitting -> plane normal
