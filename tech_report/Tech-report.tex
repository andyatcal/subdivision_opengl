\section{Introduction}

\section{Halfedge Data Structure} \label{sec:halfedge}

An object in 3D Euclid space can be represented by multiple meshes of polygons. A mesh comprises three types of geometry element: vertex, edge, and face. The adjacency structure stores the topological information (adjacency and connectivity) of the mesh. The author chose halfedge data structure as the adjacency structure in this project to realize Catmull-Clark subdivision.

\subsection{Vertex, Halfedge, and Face}

The definitions and assumptions of vertex, halfedge and face are shown in Table \ref{table:vhfdef}. An example for a face made with four halfedges is shown in Figure \ref{figure:singleFace}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{0.4\textwidth} | p{0.4\textwidth}|}
\hline
		&	Definition	& Assumption	\\
\hline
Vertex	&	A 3-dimensional point.		&	There are no overlapping vertices (vertices that share the same position) in a mesh. But overlapping vertices can exist in different meshes.		\\
\hline
Halfedge	&	An edge that starts from one vertex and end at another vertex. & A halfedge connects exactly two non-overlapping vertices and it has a direction. Less than two halfedges start from the same vertex and end at the same vertex in a single mesh.\\
\hline
Face		&	A polygon that contains a loop of vertices and halfedges.	& A face has at least three non-overlapping vertices so it makes a polygon.\\
