# subdivision_opengl
This is a school project at UC Berkeley. The final goal is to create a good CAD to to emunate sculptures through catmull-clark subdivsion on the initial polygon mesh.
Subdivision kernel is written in C++ and a modifed halfedge data structure.
Input of this subdivision kernel includes: 1) files that describe polygon meshes: SIF, STL, and OBJ; and 2) a graphical user interface to create and modify initial polygon mesh.
Output of this subdivision kernel includes: 1) files that describe polygon meshes: SIF, STL, and OBJ; and 2) a graphical user interface with OpenGL.
